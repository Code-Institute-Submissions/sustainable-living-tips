            <li><strong>Donate or Recycle:</strong> Instead of throwing away items in good condition, donate them to charity or recycle them properly to extend their lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimize Packaging:</strong> Choose products with minimal packaging or packaging made from recyclable or biodegradable materials.</li>
